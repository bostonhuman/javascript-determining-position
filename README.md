# JavaScript Determining Position

The event object can tell you where the cursor was positioned when an event was triggered. In this example, as you move your mouse around the screen, the text inputs across the top of the page are updated with the current mouse position. This demonstrates the three different positions you can retrieve when the mouse is moved or when one of the buttons is clicked. Note how showPosition() is passed event as a parameter, which refers to the event object. The positions are all properties of this event object.
